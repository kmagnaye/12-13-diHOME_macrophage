# 12-13-diHOME_macrophages

This repository includes scripts to perform quality control and processing of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets and downstream statistical analyses in R to examine the effect of 12,13-diHOME on the transcriptome in primary human macrophages, the transcriptome of mouse lungs, and chromatin accessibility of primary human macrophages.
